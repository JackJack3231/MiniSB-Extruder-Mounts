# Fusion360 MiniSB Export script

This is a python script to quickly export most of the STLs of this MiniSB mod.

As the number of parts per extruder has grown quite large (~27 per extruder) exporting every STL one by one got quite tedious, this script finishes this task for me.

While this script was specifically made for this project and thus cannot be used directly for other projects it can be used as reference/inspiration for your projects.
