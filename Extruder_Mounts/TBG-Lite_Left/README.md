# MiniSB TBG-Lite Left

## PTFE-Holder

The TBG-Lite doesn't hold a PTFE-Reverse Bowden tube by itself, for this the PTFE-Holder is included. Mount by removing the top-right Screw and pushing on the PTFE-Holder and then securing it with a M3x30 BHCS.

The orientation in which the PTFE-Holder is printed makes it crucial that you have good layer adhesion. If you have issues with the part breaking during installation try printing it rotated by 90Â°, so the PTFE-Hole is at the top and the mounting holes at the bottom.
