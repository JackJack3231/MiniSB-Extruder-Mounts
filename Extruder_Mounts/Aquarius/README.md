## About the Stock Motor

It seems like at some point the stock motor that can be bought with this Extruder changed.
In the CAD and on most product pages the motor is 25.5 mm long. However, some units are only 22 mm long.
If you received one of the shorter motors you might be able to use the MOONS spacers and no bottom spacers for the strain relief. If you have the longer motor you will need the bottom spacer and `Stock_Motor` Spacers.

## Printed Parts

- 1x Hotend Mount
- 1x Cowling of your choice
- 1x Strain Relief Plate for your wiring setup (CAN, Timmit Umbilical or stock)
- 2x Spacer Octagon or Round according to your used motor
- 1x PTFE-Guide

If you are using a motor which is longer than 21 mm, like the stock motor sold as an option with this extruder, you will need to print the plates and spacers marked `Stock_Motor`.
