# Rapido HF/Dragon UHF Cowlings
All these cowlings are currently untested.

They were created by cutting of the bottom part of the fan duct and adding the extended ducts by Mavericks Rapido HF mod.

For the Rapido Hotend, you will also need to print the [Rapido Hotend Mount](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/blob/master/printer_mods/Maverick/MiniSB_Rapido/STLs/FS_Hotend_Mount_Phaetus_Rapido.stl) from Mavericks original mod.

Other than that everything else should work just the same, so you'll need the same BOM as all the standard cowlings.

**Remember that this will reduce a bit of the usable z height, so update your firmware configuration.**
