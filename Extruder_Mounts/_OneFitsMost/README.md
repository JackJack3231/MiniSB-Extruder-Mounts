# One Fits Most Mount a.k.a. Swiss Cheese
This is a variant of the Minified Cowling that allows you to mount many extruders while having to print very few files.

The Cowling itself supports the Sherpa Mini, Libra Mini, TBG-Lite Left and Right, the Vz-Hextrudort Low CNC and the LGX Lite. The Sherpa Micro and Orbiter v2.0 can be used by printing a adapter plate each.

## BOM
For the needed parts check the README in the "standard" folder of each extruder.

You will only need additional parts if you need a adapter plate, in which case you will need an additional 6 Heatsets and 4 M3x12 BHCS.

Also keep in mind that if you need a adapter plate that your PTFE-Tube has to be 6mm longer.
