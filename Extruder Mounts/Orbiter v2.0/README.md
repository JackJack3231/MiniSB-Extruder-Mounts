# MiniSB Orbiter v2.0
## Versions
There are two Versions: The CAD-Version has the exact Mounting-Hole spacing from the Orbiter-CAD-File. The Offset-Version has the left Mounting-Hole moved 0.4mm outside, because the Orbiter v2.0 that i have has a 0.4mm offset Mounting-Hole from the CAD. To check which version you need use some calipers and measure the shortest distance of the Mounting-Holes: 33.80mm -> CAD-Version, 34.20mm -> Offset Version.
